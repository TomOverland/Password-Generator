## Description
This application will randomly generate a password that is strong and secure.  
Once you click the "generate password" button, the application will present you with a series of prompts for password criteria.  
You will select how long you would like the password to be, with a minimum length of 8 characters, and a maximum length of 128 characters.  
You will then choose to select lowercase, uppercase, symbols, and numeric characters.  
Once all prompts are answered, then a password will be generated that matches the selected criteria and displayed on the page.  

## Installation
If all files are kept in a single folder a web browser should be able to run the project.  
You will need an internet connection.  

## Credits

## Contributing
